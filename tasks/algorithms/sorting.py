Sorting Algorithms Tasks

Practice implementing various sorting algorithms from scratch.
Each function should sort a list in ascending order.

def bubble_sort(arr):
    """
    Implement the bubble sort algorithm.
    
    Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements
    and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
    
    Args:
        arr (list): List of comparable elements
        
    Returns:
        list: Sorted list in ascending order
        
    Example:
        >>> bubble_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])
        [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]

def merge_sort(arr):
    """
    Implement the merge sort algorithm.
    
    Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array
    into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
    
    Args:
        arr (list): List of comparable elements
        
    Returns:
        list: Sorted list in ascending order
        
    Example:
        >>> merge_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])
        [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
    """
    # TODO: Implement merge sort
    pass


def quick_sort(arr):
    """
    Implement the quick sort algorithm.
    
    Quick sort picks an element as pivot and partitions the array around
    the picked pivot, then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
    
    Args:
        arr (list): List of comparable elements
        
    Returns:
        list: Sorted list in ascending order
        
    Example:
        >>> quick_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])
        [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]

    # TODO: Implement quick sort

def insertion_sort(arr):
    """
    Implement the insertion sort algorithm.
    
    Insertion sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time by
    inserting each element into its correct position.
    
    Args:
        arr (list): List of comparable elements
        
    Returns:
        list: Sorted list in ascending order
